Intializing a repository:

1. Create a project directory
2. Initialize empty git repository with "git init"

Git workflow:
Modify Files, when it reacts a state we want to record, we commit them.
Committing is like creating a snapshot of your project
- Staging area/Index, area in which we essentially propose what we are
planning for your next commit. Modified files gets added to index and then
make a commit to the repository.

git commit -m "..." where all the words inside the quotes describes the 
what is being done with the commit
Committing doesnt remove whats in the staging area
-When deleting files from your working/project directory, remember to run the
git add cmd for the deleted file to remove it from the staging area
then commit
