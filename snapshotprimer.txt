Intializing a repository:

1. Create a project directory
2. Initialize empty git repository with "git init"

Git workflow:
Modify Files, when it reacts a state we want to record, we commit them.
Committing is like creating a snapshot of your project
- Staging area/Index, area in which we essentially propose what we are
planning for your next commit. Modified files gets added to index and then
make a commit to the repository.

git commit -m "..." where all the words inside the quotes describes the 
what is being done with the commit
Committing doesnt remove whats in the staging area
-When deleting files from your working/project directory, remember to run the
git add cmd for the deleted file to remove it from the staging area
then commit

 
git diff --staged compares what was in your last commit to whats currently
in the staging area

Below is an example of a git diff --staged output

The minuses show changes with the last commit, the pluses denote change with 
whats in the current staging. The numbers denote what line the change start
and how many lines has been changed and below that is the resulting output
