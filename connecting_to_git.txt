Create a directory that will work as your local repository
CD into said directory
1. Use command: "git init" to initalize directory

2. Use command: "git config --global user.name "*insert username*" "
                "git config --global user.email "*insert email*" "

3. You can connect to git utilizing ssh keys. You have already created a file with instructions on how to do this but as a
quick reminder you will use the following cmds:

ssh-keygen -t *type of cypher* -C "*your github email addy*
	this creates the keypair, the command will also make you choose a location on where to save the keypair
	Typically in your ~/users/.ssh/*cyphername*.pub

4. Once keypair is created, go into your github account, into settings and copy and paste your public key into your account

5. From there you can attempt to connect/clone an existing repository with the following cmds:
git remote add origin *ssh-url*
	ssh-url typically in the syntax of  git@github.com:*username*/*reponame*.git
	This creates a bookmark to your remote repository onto your local machine

git clone -b master *ssh-url*
	creates an identical local copy of an existing repository
