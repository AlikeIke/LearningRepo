#rsync syncs/copy data from 1 directory to another, isnt a bidirectional sync
#rsync utilizes ssh

#--dry-run flag activates a demo mode that does a testrun and calculates what would have done if dry run wasnt there
# -r is for recursive -v will actually show output of what was copied
syntax: rsync -rv --dry-run *what you want to backup* *where you want to back it up to*
