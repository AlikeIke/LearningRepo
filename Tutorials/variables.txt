Variable declaration is as simple as making a variable name putting an equal next to it and assigning a value
Referencing variables requires using a dollar sign

When in a bash script, echoing a statement with DOUBLE QUOTES allows the bash script to read a referenced variable($) with its actual value. Single quotes will print out what is
literally there

setting a variable equal to a command in paranthesis is called a subshell, this causes the command in the paranthesesis to be run in the background and stored in that variable

Example: files=$(ls)
echo "$files" if in bash
echo $files in cmdline

env cmd tells you what System/Environmental preset variables you have
